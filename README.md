# opensuse-staging-tools
Tools for aiding in the staging workflow.


## userscript
A collection of userscripts that can be installed in a browser to aid in reviews. The `osc` command line tool can also be used, but certain aspects of the web display are desirable while the workflow can be cumbersome. These scripts attempt to bridge the gap.

- [OBS Open Incoming Reviews](https://github.com/jberry-suse/opensuse-staging-tools/raw/master/userscript/obs-open-incoming-reviews.user.js): Open the first ten incoming reviews displayed on user page.
- [OBS Request Accept Hotkey](https://github.com/jberry-suse/opensuse-staging-tools/raw/master/userscript/obs-request-accept-hotkey.user.js): Jump to leaper comment and listen for `alt` + `a`.
